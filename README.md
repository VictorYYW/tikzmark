# The tikzmark Package

This is the official home of the development repository for the
`tikzmark` library for LaTeX.
This package is for marking a position on a page or within a
`tikzpicture` which can be referred to in another TikZ drawing.

The current published version can be
found [on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikzmark?lang=en) and the
documentation is there as a PDF.

To use the most recent version, download the file `tikzmark.dtx`.  To
generate the library files, run `tex tikzmark.dtx`.  To generate the
documentation, run `pdflatex tikzmark.dtx`.
